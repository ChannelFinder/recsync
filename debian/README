Setup for Debian.

The init script /etc/init.d/recceiver is a no-op unless the config file
(default /etc/recceiver.conf) exists.  A sample is provided as
/etc/recceiver.conf.example.

If the sqlite3 DB backend is used then the .db file must be initialized as follows.
This file must be read/write-able by the user account under which the recceiver daemon runs.
By default this is "recceiver"

$ sqlite3 /path/to/somefile.db -init usr/share/doc/recceiver/recceiver.sqlite3 .exit
$ sudo chown recceiver /path/to/somefile.db

Note that "/path/to/somefile.db" is a place holder.  Whatever path is used
must by specified with "dbname" in the config file.
