Server testing

#Setup

$ sqlite3 test.db -init recceiver.sqlite3 .exit

Run (for twistd <= 16.0.3)

$ twistd -n recceiver -f demo.conf

or (see below for discussion)

$ twistd -r poll -n recceiver -f demo.conf

Run (for twistd >= 16.0.4)

$ PYTHONPATH=$PWD twistd -r poll -n recceiver -f demo.conf

At some point 'twistd' stopped implicitly searching the working directory.

May need to uncomment 'addrlist = 127.255.255.255:5049' in demo.conf
when doing local testing on a computer w/ a firewall.

Twisted 14.0.2 seems to have a problem with the epoll() reactor
which raises 'IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory'
during startup.  Try with the poll() reactor.

## Database Minimum Configuration
Recceiver currently manages the following:
*hostName
** name of the host running the IOC
*iocName
** IOC and in EPICS
*pvStatus
** true or false, being used or not
*iocid
** U/K need to find documentation for this
*time
** last time the above properties were changed

Recceiver requires these set of these properties to be set as well as at least one tag.

#Invoke
$ twistd -r poll -n recceiver -f demo.conf
