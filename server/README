Server testing

Run

$ twistd -n recceiver -f demo.conf

May need to uncomment 'addrlist = 127.255.255.255:5049' in demo.conf
when doing local testing on a computer w/ a firewall.

Twisted 14.0.2 seems to have a problem with the epoll() reactor
which raises 'IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory'
during startup.  Try with the poll() reactor.

twistd -r poll -n recceiver -f demo.conf
